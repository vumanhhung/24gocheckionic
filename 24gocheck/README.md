##Quick Start
###A guide to quickly set up and running the i2CSMobile app

This guide will explain you how to setup the app quickly using an ionic starter template. Extract the content of the downloaded zip file. The package contains two folders for `ionic` app and `opencart` module. Open your CMD or terminal and navigate to the place where you would like your project to be initialized (Ex. `C:\projects\`).
```
I2CSMOBILE_PACKAGE
|__ ionic
|   |__ starter
|   |__ full-package
|__ opencart
    |__ ***
```

This product is based on ionic platform. You have to install ionic CLI if you haven't done it yet. Please refer to [Installing the CLI globally](http://ionicframework.com/docs/cli/install.html)

####1. CREATE AN APP
```
ionic start myapp "C:\I2CSMOBILE_PACKAGE\ionic\starter\www"
cd myapp
```

####2. INSTALL DEPENDENCIES

Note: You need to provide `GCM_PROJECT_NUMBER` When installing push notification plugin. Please follow [this tutorial](http://docs.ionic.io/docs/push-overview) to get a `GCM_PROJECT_NUMBER`. The latest plugin update requires that a SENDER_ID variable be set for Android. That is actually your GCM Project Number. If you're not using Android, you'll just need to pass a random string (you could even use the above command as-is).

```
####4. ADD PLATFORMS

```
####5. BUILD IT FOR A PLATFORM OR SEE IT IN BROWSER 

You can build the apk with following command. Make sure you have installed Android SDK on your computer before running this.
```
ionic build android
```

Or you can test the app in your web browser by entering following command. Note that you can use `ionic serve` to start a local development server for app dev and testing. Most of the mobile app specific features (ex. Push notifications .etc) are disabled when you run `ionic serve` command.
```
ionic serve
```
